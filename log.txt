Add inheritance support

03.06.2022
While playing with the interpreter there is a bug related to prefix and postfix Operations(
    --this.a; // this was leading to Error
    FIXED!!
)

Add support for symantic analysis
Bug fix, i.e. check for return keyword that is not inside a function or a method

30.05.2022
Added support for do while loop
Added support for repeat loop
Added support for ++ and -- prefix operator
Add support for more assignment operators(+=, -=, *=, /=)
Fixed a bug related to lambda expression parsing (
    if i write,
        fun sq(n) => n * n;
    here, the semi-colon was not consumed for a function declaration. For a lambda expression
    like,
        var sq = fun(n) => n * n; 
    here there is no required for consuming for semi-colon, but for function declaration that is a requirement.
)
Added support for modulus operator(%, %=)

25.05.2022
Added support for return keyword.
Added support for anonymous function

Added Break and Continue Statements

22.05.2022
Fixed bug related to Scanner (
    For "a=" the scanner was creating only one Token i.e. Token(IDENTIFIER, "a=")
    it was because of a advance statement in the identifier() function(was in first line).
    My logic was wrong, in the getToken() function when char ch = advance(); is done then itself
    we go to the next token so inside identifier() the call to advance() was unrequired.
    T.T
